## FastQC

See [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc) for details about FastQC.

The pipeline analyzes the raw data and generates for each file a FastQC report. All report are collected in MultiQC.

**Output directory: `results/fastqc`**

- `.html`
  - Contains the FastQC report.
- `.zip`
  - Contains additional information, such as individual plots, and FastQC raw data.

:::note
The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows the unprocessed reads. Depending on the protocol,
they may contain barcodes, UMIs and adapter sequences.

## Cellranger

Cell Ranger is a set of analysis scripts that processes 10x Chromium single cell data to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices, perform clustering and other secondary analysis. See [Cellranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) for more information on Cellranger.

**Output directory: `results/cellranger`**

- Contains the mapped BAM files, filtered and unfiltered HDF5 matrices and output metrics created by Cellranger

## Cellranger ARC

Cell Ranger ARC is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression sequencing data to generate a variety of analyses pertaining to gene expression (GEX), chromatin accessibility, and their linkage. Furthermore, since the ATAC and GEX measurements are on the very same cell, we are able to perform analyses that link chromatin accessibility and GEX. See [Cellranger ARC](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-multiome-atac-gex/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger-arc) for more information on Cellranger.

**Output directory: `results/cellrangerarc`**

- Contains the mapped BAM files, filtered and unfiltered HDF5 matrices and output metrics created by Cellranger ARC

## Cellranger multi

Cell Ranger Multi is the 10x analysis pipeline for *multi*omics and *multi*plexed experiments. See [Cell Ranger Multi]()
for the corresponding documentation.

**Output directory: `results/cellrangermulti`**

- Overall same output structure as cellranger. In case of multiplexed samples there will be one ouput folder for
  each demultiplexed sample, and one containing all (non-demultiplexed) cells.

## Cellbender remove background filter

The pipeline also possess a subworkflow imported from scdownstream to perform filter empty drops using [cellbender](https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender) remove background function. The process is simple, it takes a raw/unfiltered matrix file, and performs the filltering on it, generating another matrix file.

> Users can turn it of with `--skip_cellbender`.

**Output directory: `results/${params.aligner}/${meta.id}/cellbender_removebackground`**

- Contains the cellbender filtered matrices results generated by the remove background functionality.

## Other output data

**Output directory: `results/reference_genome`**

- `barcodes`
  - Contains the utilized cell barcode whitelists (if applicable)
- `extract_transcriptome`
  - When supplied with a `--fasta` genome fasta, this contains the extracted transcriptome
  - The GTF file supplied with `--gtf` is used to extract the transcriptome positions appropriately

**Output directory: `results/${params.aligner}/mtx_conversions`**

- `*_matrix.h5ad`
  - `.mtx` files converted to [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in `.h5ad` format, using [scanpy package](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
  - One per sample and a single one with all samples concatenated together `combined_matrix.h5ad`
- `*_matrix.rds`
  - `.mtx` files converted to R native data format, rds, using the [Seurat package](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat)
  - One per sample

Because the pipeline has both the data directly from the aligners, and from the cellbender empty-drops filtering module, the conversion modules were
modified to understand the difference between raw/filtered from the aligners itself and filtered from the empty-drops module.
So, to try to avoid confusion by the user, we added "suffixes" to the generated converted files so that we have provenance from what input it came from.

So, the conversion modules generate data with the following syntax: **`*_{raw,filtered,cellbender_filter}_matrix.{h5ad,rds}`**. With the following meanings:

| suffix            | meaning                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| raw               | Conversion of the raw/unprocessed matrix generated by the tool. It is also used for tools that generate only one matrix, such as alevin. |
| filtered          | Conversion of the filtered/processed matrix generated by the tool                                                                        |
| cellbender_filter | Conversion of the matrix that was generated by the cellbender remove background filtering module                                         |

> Some aligners, like `alevin` do not produce both raw&filtered matrices. When aligners give only one output, they are treated with the `raw` suffix.
> Some aligners may have an option to give both raw&filtered and only one, like `kallisto`. Be aware when using the tools.

## MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.### Pipeline information

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
